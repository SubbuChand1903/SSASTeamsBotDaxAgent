SSAS DAX Agent using LangGraph that integrates directly with Microsoft Teams. The goal is to let users type natural language questions in Teams and automatically translate them into DAX queries.

The agent will:

Capture natural language queries from Teams.

Convert them into valid DAX expressions using the LangGraph pipeline.

Execute the DAX queries against the SSAS Tabular model.

Retrieve the results and present them back to users in Teams in an easy-to-read format.

This approach removes the complexity of writing DAX manually and empowers business users to self-serve insights directly within their Teams environment.
